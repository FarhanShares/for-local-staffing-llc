      <p>
        Imagine this: back in 2012, as a teenager, I created my Facebook account
        out of pure curiosity. Little did I know that this simple act would
        ignite my passion for coding. I wondered and Googled how Facebook and
        Websites were created! I embarked on a self-guided journey, learning
        PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS in my 10th grade. What began as a hobby
        transformed into a relentless pursuit of knowledge and problem-solving
        skills. Today, as I venture into the world of veterinary science, I
        bring a unique blend of coding expertise and analytical thinking.

      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium leading-tight">Psst! Why Veterinary?</h3>
      <p>
        I was loving every moment of my self-taught journey. It was a world
        brimming with creativity and the freedom to choose my own path. No rigid
        syllabus held me back. I decided to delve into the fascinating realm of
        bio-science, driven purely by my passion for exploration. Back then,
        making money was never my focus; it was all about following my heart's
        desire for knowledge and pure enjoyment.
