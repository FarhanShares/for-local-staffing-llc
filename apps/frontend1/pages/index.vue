        work remotely, and also am not actively searching for a job. However,
        when I came across this job posting, I couldn't resist applying because
        it truly feels like a dream job â€” an incredible opportunity that aligns
        perfectly with my aspirations and skills. That being said, let's get to
        my story and why I think we are are a great fit for each other.

      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium leading-tight mt">My Story</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine this: back in 2012, as a teenager, I created my Facebook account
        out of pure curiosity. Little did I know that this simple act would
        ignite my passion for coding. I wondered, and Googled, "How Facebook and
        other Websites were created!" I embarked on a self-guided journey,
        learning PHP, HTML, CSS and a bit of MySQL in my 10th grade. What began
        as a hobby transformed into a relentless pursuit of knowledge and
        problem-solving skills. Today, as I'm graduating as a veterinary doctor.

      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium leading-tight">Why Life Science?</h3>
      <p>
        I was loving every moment of my self-taught journey. No rigid
        tech-syllabus held me back. I decided to delve into the fascinating
        realm of life-science, driven purely by my passion for exploration. Back
        then, making money was never my focus; it was all about following my
        heart's desire for knowledge and pure enjoyment.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium leading-tight">How it went?</h3>
      <p>
        Initially, I made a whole lot of trail & error, exploring to & fro and
        sweating for the simplest bug. The more I spent my times, eventually the
        more it started to become clearer. I used to code in
        <code>Raw PHP</code>, then <code>Composer</code> came in,
        <code>Laravel</code> was highly popular in PHP's world. I started my
        journey with it. Lately, I've created an open source Laravel Package
        too, called

          href="https://github.com/farhanshares/laravel-mediaman"
        >
          Laravel MediaMan</a
        >. However, <code>Javascript</code> soon became (and still it is) the
        trend, it can do all the fancy stuffs and everyone was adopting it
        quickly, so did I. Initially, I started with <code>ReactJS</code> then
        <code>VueJS</code>. I got hired for mid-level to lead positions as a
        Frontend Developer Role (VueJS) at different organizations from local
        and beyond border, counting 3+ years.

      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium leading-tight">Hmm, anything else?</h3>
      <p>
        Tech is something where I find joy, I've spent times on learning the
        principles like a CS graduate would do. Operating System, Computer
        Networking, Filesystem, Database, DSA, Coding Patterns (e.g. Proxy,
        Builder, Facade), Principles (e.g. DRY, SOLID, KISS, YAGNI) â€” I've tried
        my best to get a good grip in it. I often do problem solving and lately
        started leetcoding to sharpen my logical thinking.

        There is a bunch more I would love to talk about, but I hope I've
        already convinced you <em>enough</em> to start a conversation. I am
        looking forward to your response / feedback!
