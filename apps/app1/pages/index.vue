        >, a 25 y/o developer living in Dinajpur, Bangladesh. I currently still
        work remotely, and also am not actively searching for a job. However,
        when I came across this job posting, I couldn't resist applying because
        it truly feels like a dream job â€” an incredible opportunity that aligns
        perfectly with my aspirations and skills. That being said, let's get to
        my story and why I think we are are a great fit for each other.

      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium leading-tight mt">My Story</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine this: back in 2012, as a teenager, I created my Facebook account
        out of pure curiosity. Little did I know that this simple act would
        ignite my passion for coding. I wondered, and Googled, "How Facebook and
        other Websites are created!" I embarked on a self-guided journey,
        learning PHP, HTML, CSS and a bit of MySQL in my 10th grade. What began
        as a hobby transformed into a relentless pursuit of knowledge and
        problem-solving skills. Today, as I'm graduating as a veterinary doctor.

      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium leading-tight">Wait, Why Life Science?</h3>
      <p>
        I was loving every moment of my self-taught journey. No rigid
        tech-syllabus held me back. I decided to delve into the fascinating
        realm of life-science for exploration of how biology ticks. For me,
        programming was driven purely by my passion, a hobby, which I wanted to
        grow in my dream way. Back then, making money was never my intention; it
        was all about following my heart's desire for knowledge and pure
        enjoyment.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium leading-tight">How it went?</h3>
      <p>
        Initially, I made a whole lot of trail & error, exploring to & fro and
        sweating for the simplest bug. The more I spent my times, eventually the
        more it started to become clearer. I used to code in
        <code>Raw PHP</code>, then <code>Composer</code> came in,
        <code>Laravel</code> was highly popular in PHP's world. I started my
        journey with it. Lately, I've created an open source Laravel Package
        too, called

          href="https://github.com/farhanshares/laravel-mediaman"
        >
          Laravel MediaMan</a
        >. However, <code>Javascript</code> soon became (and still it is) the
        trend, it can do all the fancy stuffs and everyone was adopting it
        quickly, so did I. Initially, I started with <code>ReactJS</code> then
        switched to <code>VueJS</code>. I got hired for mid-level to leading
        positions as a Frontend Developer (VueJS) at different organizations
        from local and beyond border, counting 3+ years.

      OTORide & RateItAll are my recent successful projects. OTORide is an IOT
      Mobility Sharing SAAS App, RateItAll is a social network for reviewing any
      topics.

      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium leading-tight">Hmm, anything else?</h3>
      <p>
        Tech is something where I find joy, I've spent times on learning the
        principles like a CS graduate would do. Operating System, Computer
        Networking, Filesystem, Database, DSA, Coding Patterns (e.g. Proxy,
        Builder, Facade etc.), Principles (e.g. DRY, SOLID, KISS, YAGNI etc.) â€”
        I've tried my best to get a good grip in it. I often do problem solving
        and lately started leetcoding to sharpen my logical thinking.

        Listening..but full-stack?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely! As a full-stack developer, I excel in developing REST APIs
        and handling dev-ops tasks. I know how to use Docker, Nginx or CI/CD in
        production server. Laravel is my preferred PHP framework for backend
        development. I've started exploring Express.js and Koa.js, thanks to
        your guidance via articles. I am well-versed in testing methodologies
        like TDD. I have some

        There is a bunch more I would love to talk about, but I hope I've
        already convinced you <em>enough</em> to start a conversation. I am
        looking forward to your response / feedback!
